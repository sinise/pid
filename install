instal wireringpi

        sudo apt-get install git-core

If you get any errors here, make sure your Pi is up to date with the latest versions of Raspbian:

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get upgrade

To obtain WiringPi using GIT:

        git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi

If you have already used the clone operation for the first time, then

        cd wiringPi
        git pull origin

Will fetch an updated version then you can re-run the build script below.

To build/install there is a new simplified script:

        cd wiringPi
        ./build

The new build script will compile and install it all for you â€“ it does use the sudo command at one point,$
