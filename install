instal wireringpi and lamp and java
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install openjdk......
	sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-client mysql-server tomcat6 vsftpd
        sudo apt-get install git-core

        git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi

To build/install there is a new simplified script:
        cd wiringPi
        ./build
The new build script will compile and install it all for you â€“ it does use the sudo command at one point,$


If you have already used the clone operation for the first time, then

        cd wiringPi
        git pull origin

Will fetch an updated version then you can re-run the build script below.
